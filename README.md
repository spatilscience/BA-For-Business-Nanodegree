# Business Analytics Nanodegree

# Nanodegree Program Info
From Udacity - This program is an excellent program for non-technical people who want to make more data driven decisions.
You’ll learn data analysis skills and tools that will help you throughout your career, whether you’re in
engineering, sales, marketing, operations, etc. You’ll learn to use Excel, SQL, and Tableau to manipulate,
analyze, and visualize data with the end goal of making better, data-informed decisions. This program is also
great preparation for more advanced programs, such as the Data Analyst or Business Analyst Nanodegree
programs. Depending on how quickly you work through the material, the amount of time required is variable.
We have included an hourly estimation for each section of the program. The program is three months long
(approx. 13 weeks). If you spend about 10 hours per week working through the program, you should finish
each term within the 13 weeks. Students will have an additional four weeks beyond the end of the term to
complete all projects.

Version: 4.0.0
Length of Program: 67 Days*
*This is a self-paced program and the length is an estimation of total hours the average student may take to complete all required coursework,
including lecture and project time. Actual hours may vary.
